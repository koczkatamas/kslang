# What is OneLang.io?

OneLang has a **hard time defining itself**.

Some may call it a **transpiler**, a special compiler which can compile source code from an input language to another. Those will have a hard time using it, as OneLang has its own rules and **does not respect** those of the input language, sometimes not even its syntax.

So the question arises, is OneLang a **new programming language**? Although we can talk about it with words like **object-oriented** or **generic** or **strongly-typed**, it has its own type system and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), would you call something a programming language which **does not have its own syntax**?

Thus let's just define OneLang as the following for the time being: **OneLang is a tool which helps writing code in multiple languages at the same time**.

It doesn't solve the problem for you, it just helps you a bit in it. You still need to master the target languages and OneLang to be able to produce anything usable.
